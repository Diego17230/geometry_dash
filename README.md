# Geometry Dash
A clone of geometry dash, but it goes infinitely! There is an additional option to watch a bot play perfectly.
Visit the website [here](https://geodash-school.herokuapp.com/index).

## Installing
Go to the website to the "Download" bar and proceed from there. Alternatively, you can go to the [GitHub release](https://github.com/Diego17230/geometry_dash/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and download the file (not the source code) from there.

## Playing
Open the installed app, no installs required! The installed app should be in your Downloads directory. If a security warning appears, go into Finder and right click the app. Then select the open option and finish starting up the app.
