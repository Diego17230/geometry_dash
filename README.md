# Geometry Dash
A clone of geometry dash, but it goes infinitely! There is an additional option to watch a bot play perfectly.
Visit the website [here](https://geodash-school.herokuapp.com/index).

## Installing
Go to the website to the "Download" bar and proceed from there. Alternatively, you can go to the [GitHub release](https://github.com/Diego17230/geometry_dash/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and download the file (not the source code) from there.

## Playing
Open the installed app, no installs required! The installed app should be in your Downloads directory. During installation, you might see a "Unconfirmed crdownload NUMBER" in your Downloads directory. If that happens, just click the option to send the zip file to Chrome to check for malware (this option is in Chrome, not in Finder). If a security warning appears, go into Finder and right click the app. Then select the open option and finish starting up the app.
